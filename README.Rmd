From the [Open Bangsamoro website](https://www.openbangsamoro.com/)

> The [**OpenBangsamoro** initiative](https://www.openbangsamoro.com) supports the use of open statistical, geospatial, and administrative data for transparent, accountable, and participatory decision-making as the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) transforms into the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao.

The `openbangsamoro` R package supports this effort by providing an application programming interface to the [Open Bangsamoro shared Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1W8JV4hth_gs1V6efb92HMz0eU2LRYbOO). Consistent with the principles of Open Bangsamoro, the `openbangsamoro` R package is built and distributed open source on a platform that allows and encourages community contribution using a programming language that is also open and freely available to use.

We believe that through this added layer of interface to the Open Bangsamoro datasets, a cadre of users and developers - including those from Bangsamoro itself - can support the process of mapmaking, placemaking, and decision-making that the Open Bangsamoro effort has initiated and continue to encourage.

## What does `openbangsamoro` do?

Please note that `openbangsamoro` is still highly experimental and is undergoing a lot of development. Hence, any functionalities described below and in the rest of the package documentation have a high likelihood of changing interface or approach as we aim for a stable working version.

Currently, the package provides functions for retrieving Google Drive specific drive information for the Open Bangsamoro Google Drive and its sub-directories.

## Installation

`openbangsamoro` is not yet on CRAN but can be installed from the [panukatan R universe](https://panukatan.r-universe.dev) as follows:

```{r install-r-universe, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(
  "openbangsamoro",
  repos = c('https://panukatan.r-universe.dev', 'https://cloud.r-project.org')
)
```
